## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking

### Decomposition: What smaller steps form your chosen algorithm?
Smaller steps which form the binary search site

- Parse Input
    - Read array as comma and space separated string
    - Convert to 'List[int]' and sort by ascending
    - Read target value as 'int'

- Initialize Search State 
    - lo = 0 and hi is len(array) - 1
    - mid = none, step = 0, finished = False and found_index = none
    - Store everything in a state dictionary type setup that gradio passes between calls

- Single Search Step 
    - If lo > hi then mark treasure not found and stop
    - Compute mid
    - Compare mid with target
        - If equal mark found and stop
        - If less move lo = mid + 1
        - If more move hi = mid - 1

- Visual & Audio Updates
    - Be able to have audio done for every step such as when treasure is found or not found
    - Return proper visuals and sound effects
    - Connect buttons to core functions of binary search 

### Pattern Recognition: How does it repeatedly reach, compare, or swap values?

- Recognizes array is sorted
- Repeats the divide and conquer pattern:
    - Always jump to the middle index between lo and hi
    - Compare mid to target
    - Discard the half the remaining search space
- The same pattern runs for every step until:
    - A match is found
    - lo > hi then target does not exist within array

- Visual Reptition
    - Ship always moves to the middle island
    - Islands outside the current window are faded out

### Abstraction: Which details of the process should be shown to the user and how to show it, and which details should be discarded (i.e., not shown)?

- Shown to the user
    - Island row
    - Pointers 
    - Status/Explanations
    - Audio

- Hidden from the user
    - Code for image display and audio autoplay in background
    - UI internals of Gradio 

### Algorithm Design: How will input → processing → output flow to and from the user? Including the use of the graphical user interface (GUI). Note you are free to choose the datatypes and structures of input (e.g., integer and list or string and linked list, etc.) as long as it is explicitly stated. Include this plan as a short section with a flowchart diagram in your README.

**Data types / structures**

- Array (islands)
    - GUI: numeric (Gradio 'Number')
    - Internal: 'List[int]' after parsing and sorting

- Target (treasure value)
    - GUI: numeric (Gradio 'Number')
    - Internal: 'int'

- Search state (single dictionary)  
  - `state = { "array": List[int], "target": int, "lo": int, "hi": int, "mid": Optional[int], "step": int, "finished": bool, "found_index": Optional[int] }`

- Generator inputs
    - `range_start: int`, `range_end: int`, `mode: str ("Both" | "Even" | "Odd")`.  
    - Output: a generated comma-separated string that populates the array textbox.
